# Perceptron-Class-Design
A Jupyter notebook focused on designing and testing a Perceptron class in Python using NumPy. This activity introduces the logic and structure behind implementing machine learning algorithms through object-oriented programming principles.

## Overview
This notebook focuses on designing a custom `Perceptron` class from scratch using Python and NumPy. It introduces students to the internal logic of machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on binary classification using the perceptron learning rule.

## Activity Objectives
- Build a Python class for the perceptron model
- Use NumPy arrays for mathematical operations
- Write and test methods like `fit()` and `predict()`
- Practice documenting code using class and method docstrings

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
